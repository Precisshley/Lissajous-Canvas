# WILTC5G

This is a canvas for playing with lissajous curves. 

I've had this project hanging around for a number of years yet I keep coming back to it just to tinker with it. At some point I need to properly comment and format everything, but for now it is available to run on git pages. I will also get around to explaining what anything means in the menu. Until then, I recommend having fun playing with the different options and see what you can make!


## The Controls

    The menu and certain functions (such as screenshots and resets) were built for the xbox controller.

    Otherwise, most functions can be accessed on keyboard apart from the colour button which is soon to be added.
